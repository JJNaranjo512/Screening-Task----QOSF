Hey everyone!

I created this repository to officially upload my application for the QOSF program. Feel free to check it out, and if you have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!

To the QOSF reviewers and organizers:
Thank you so much for creating this amazing program and giving students the chance to learn through hands-on experience. Working on this screening task has been a blast, and I've learned a ton along the way. I hope QOSF reaches even more people!

Cheers!
